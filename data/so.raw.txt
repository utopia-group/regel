#	NL	Sketch
1	write a regular expression that only matches strings, no numbers, no special character, just letters from A - Z.	null
2	write regular expression in C# to validate that the input does not contain double spaces	not(contain(?{< >}))
3	write regular expression that allows only digits, characters like "&" "|" "." "(" ")" and spaces	?{<num>,or(concat(<e>,concat(<n>,concat(<u>,concat(<m>,concat(<c>,concat(<o>,concat(<n>,concat(<s>,concat(<t>,<s>))))))))),< >)}
6	The input will be in the form a colon (:) separated tuple of three values. The first value will be an integer (potentially a long in terms of size/length), with the other two values being either numeric or a string.	sep(?{<num>,repeatatleast(<num>,1),<let>},<:>)
8	It should accept numbers only with decimal part "0" or "5" only.	sep(?{repeatatleast(<num>,1),or(<0>,<5>)},<.>)
9	I want this value to accept up to 18 digits before the decimal, and 1 digit after. With the decimal point and the digit after it being optional	sep(?{repeatrange(<num>,1,18),<num>},<.>)
10	The value should not contain only "%" and if there is a "%" the length should be more than 3 characters including "%". "%" can be anywhere in the string (dot is included)	TBD
11	I want to develop one regular expression which validates only strings which have "A", "B" or "C"	?{or(<A>,or(<B>,<C>))}
12	optional number of digits followed by an "X" and an optional ("^" followed by one or more digits)	concat(?{<num>},?{<X>,concat(<^>,repeatatleast(<num>,1))})
15	i need a Regular that validate Decimal (18,3) this mean max number of digits before comma is 15 and accept 3 numbers after comma . 18 precision 3 scale.	concat(?{<num>},?{<,>,repeatrange(<num>,1,3)})
18	accept numeric values that are seven or ten digits	?{or(repeat(<num>,7),repeat(<num>,10))}
20	How can i write valid regular expression for Oracle's Number(2,2), Also digits after decimal should be either, "1" or "2" but not more than "2", also it can be optional. The number should never start with [1-9] but can start with "0".	sep(?{<num>,<0>},<.>)

40	i need regular expression for : one or two digits then "." and one or two digits.	concat(or(repeat(<num>,1),repeat(<num>,2)),?{<.>,or(repeat(<num>,1),repeat(<num>,2))})
41	regular expression which validates only number and min length should be 11 and maximum 16	null
42	I need to validate the next pattern: starts with "C0" and finish with 4 digits exactly	?{concat(<C>,<0>),startwith(concat(<C>,<0>)),repeat(<num>,4)}
45	I need a regular expression that only validates UK mobile numbers. A UK mobile number can be between 10-14 digits and either starts with "07", or omits the "0" and starts with "447". Importantly, if the user adds "+44" it should be rejected.	TBD
46	I want a regular expression for decimal input, which can take 4 digits before decimal or comma and 2 digits after decimal/comma. 5 digit number without decimal is invalid.Validation show also include comma along with decimal.	sep(?{repeatrange(<num>,1,4),repeatrange(<num>,1,2)},<.>)
48	I need to validate a string that contains underscore(_) in between the numbers. Underscore character is an optional. Only condition is, it should be between the numbers.	sep(?{<num>},<_>)

75	Need a regular expression to validate number with comma separator.	sep(?{<num>},<,>)
76	valid characters are alphanumeric and "."(period). The patterns are "%d4%" and "%t7%". So "%" is not valid by itself, but has to be part of these specific patterns.	?{or(<alphanum>,<.>),or(concat(<%>,concat(<d>,concat(<4>,<%>))),concat(<%>,concat(<t>,concat(<7>,<%>))))}
77	The input box should accept alphanumeric with no space and it should also allow the user to use the characters like "~" "!" "@" "#" "$" "-" "_" any where in the string, except these characters non of the other characters should be allowed like ("%",  "&", "^" etc). It should not allow leading/trailing whitespace also.	?{<alphanum>,concat(<e>,concat(<n>,concat(<u>,concat(<m>,concat(<c>,concat(<o>,concat(<n>,concat(<s>,concat(<t>,<s>)))))))))}

86	a regular expression for validating a string with alphanumeric characters and dashes, while also not allowing leading or trailing dashes	?{<alphanum>,<->}
88	The value can have at max 3 decimals (but also none) with comma as the separator.	sep(?{repeatrange(<num>,1,3)},<,>)
89	I want to use a Regular expression validator in my line edit that doesn't allow to write dot(".") right after dot(".")	not(contain(?{concat(<.>,<.>)}))

97	start and finish with a percentage sign and can contain any number of characters in-between	null
100	The string must be 9 characters long, starting with "SO-" (case insensitive eg "So-", "so-", "sO-" and "SO-") followed by 6 numbers.	concat(or(concat(<S>,concat(<o>,<->)),or(concat(<s>,concat(<o>,<->)),or(concat(<s>,concat(<O>,<->)),concat(<S>,concat(<O>,<->))))),?{repeat(<num>,6)})
101	The first character should be a designated character like "A", "B" or "C" only. and the next 3 characters should be numbers.	?{or(<A>,or(<B>,<C>)),repeat(<num>,3),<num>}
102	I have one field that is meant to allow a 1 - 3 character string. The first character has got to be "A", "B", "C" or "Z" and may optionally be followed by up to 2 characters.	concat(or(<A>,or(<B>,or(<C>,<Z>))),?{repeatrange(<let>,1,2)})
103	I am trying to implement regex validation for passport number. My requirement is bulletpoint Length should be minimum 3 characters to a maximum of 20 characters. bulletpoint Should not be only "0"	null
