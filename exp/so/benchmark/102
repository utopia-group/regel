// natural language
I have one field that is meant to allow a 1 - 3 character string. The first character has got to be "A", "B", "C" or "Z" and may optionally be followed by up to 2 characters.

// examples
"B",+
"B6",+
"BB",+
"AB",+
"G3",-
"A B",-
"A 4",-
"6HC",-



// gt
concat(or(<A>,or(<B>,or(<C>,<Z>))),repeatrange(or(<let>,<num>),1,2))
