// natural language
I'm trying to use regular expressions to match a string that does not contain the sequence of characters of a less than symbol "<" followed by a non space.

// examples
"A new description.",+
"A < new description.",+
"it< doesn't match",+
"A <new description.",-
"it <matches",-
"<n",-



// gt
not(contain(concat(<<>,notcc(< >))))
