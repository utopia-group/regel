// natural language
I'm trying to validate a form using regular expressions, the conditions are: It has to be a numeric value. It CAN have up to three decimal places(0,1,2 are allowed too).It has to be divided by a comma(,).

// examples
"1,234",+
"2,00",+
"5",+
"0,1",+
"123545,123",+
"1,2345",-
"2.00",-
"56a",-



// gt
concat(repeatatleast(<num>,1),optional(concat(<,>,repeatrange(<num>,1,3))))
