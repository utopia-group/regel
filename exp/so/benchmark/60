I want to write a regular expression using jQuery to validate input fields which will not allow special char at end and the string length should be in between 3 - 25

// examples
"abc#123",+
"a%scsd",+
"abc453&",-
"ab",-
"123%",-
"abacvfrdfrgthgfrthgf22222",+
"abacvfrdfrgthgfrthgf222222",-




// gt
"abacvfrdfrgthgfrthgf222222",-
