// natural language
I am trying to write a regular expression which validates a text box to have only digits with length 5 or 9.‚ÄùCan any one please help me in modifying or writing a new regular expression which supports below pattern: - valid (ending with comma) -valid (not ending with comma) -Invalid (should not support if 1st digit is length 5 and 2nd less than 9) -valid (must support only digit length 5 or 9)

// example
"09103,09101,",+
"09103,09101",+
"12345,123456789",+
"12345,1234567",-

// gt
concat(or(repeat(<num>,5),repeat(<num>,9)),concat(repeatatleast(or(repeat(<num>,5),repeat(<num>,9)),1),optional(<,>)))
